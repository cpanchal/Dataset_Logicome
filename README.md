# Dataset_Logicome
The file named as NewDisjointScaledBigdata.csv contains scaled gene expression data of the significant genes and we partition this data into training and validation for our further analysis. 

The partition into training and validation is done with the ratio of 60:40 and samples are choosen randomly.

We run the algorithm for 20 times and for each run we partition the data into training and validation. The zip files named as "Datasets#.zip" are the different sets of training and validation datasets used in different run.
